# AutoID - VIN Decoder

![Project Preview](./src/assets/preview.png)

AutoID is a web application designed for decoding vehicle VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) codes. It allows users to retrieve detailed technical specifications of a vehicle quickly and efficiently by entering its unique identification number.

## 🚀 [Live Demo]()

## 📋 Key Features

- VIN Decoding: Retrieve comprehensive vehicle technical specifications via API.

- Search & Filter: Search for vehicle variables by name or group.

- Pagination: User-friendly navigation through the variables list with 15 items per page.

- Interactive UI: Fully responsive design with support for Light and Dark themes.

- Detail View: Access extended information for each specific vehicle variable.

## 🏗 Architecture & Implementation

The application is built with a modular, scalable architecture, focusing on clean separation of logic and type safety.

- API Layer: Implemented with Redux Toolkit Query for declarative data fetching. It includes a custom baseQuery with an artificial delay to demonstrate loading states and centralized error handling through transformErrorResponse.

- State Management: Uses a unified Redux store that integrates API slices and middleware, ensuring efficient cache management and data consistency.

- Theme Management: A custom ThemeProvider using React Context API handles light/dark modes, with state persistence in localStorage.

- Validation: All input data (like VIN codes) is validated using Zod schemas, ensuring data integrity before any network request is initiated.

- Domain Logic: Application configurations (API endpoints, storage keys, constants) and TypeScript interfaces are centralized in constants/ and types/ folders to act as a "single source of truth."

- Custom Hooks: Business logic is encapsulated in custom hooks (like useHistory or useTheme), keeping UI components lightweight and easy to maintain.
